# DTMF-Tones-Decoder-EEE4114F-
This is a project that contains the source code and plots of an implementation of a DTMF tone decoder and the the resulting plots generated using MATLAB.
AIM: The aim of the project is to model and implement a DTMF decoder utilizing MATLAB generated scripts. The project also investigates how factors such as noise effect the performance of the decoder. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Fast Fourier Transform (DFFT) and Spectral Analysis spectrum and correlation are used to extract the constant power spectral density of white noise from the desired multi-frequency signal.
The following were literature used in the project to gain insight into the project:

TODO:
To run the scripts they have to be downloaded and run on MATLAB
